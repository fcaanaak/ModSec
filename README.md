# ModSec

### Overview

Modsec is a modular home security system IOT project in which a network of hardware modules outfitted with different detection apparatuses communicate with a server to send detection reports to users which can be views via the ModSec mobile app. The key is easy and fast integration of new hardware modules into an existing home security network.
